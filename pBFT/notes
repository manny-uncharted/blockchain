### How a pBFT algorithm reaches a consensus?

The pBFT consensus rounds are called views and are broken into 4 phases:

As the pBFT consensus requires a leader which stands in place between the client and the backup nodes. During every view (consensus round) the leading node is changed and can be replaced with a protocol called a view change if a certain amount of time has passed without the leading node broadcasting the request.

Implementing a simple pBFT algorithm is easy. The algorithm consists of the following steps:

1. The client sends a request to the leader node to invoke a service operation.
2. The leading node broadcasts the request to the backup nodes.
3. The nodes execute the request, then send a reply to the client.
4. The client awaits  $(f +1)$ replies from different nodes with the same result, where f, equals the maximum number of potentially faulty nodes.
