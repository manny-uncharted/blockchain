# A Replication of the Proof of Work Algorithm

In the course of my research on how to apply the proof of work algorithm to a blockchain, I have created a simple replication of the proof of work algorithm.

## We've all heard about blockchain and the whole hype around cryptocurrencies.

This particular programme is a blockchain that is based on the proof of work algorithm. The proof of work algorithm is a simple algorithm that is used to ensure that the data in the blockchain is valid. Which means for a new block of data to be mined a matching hash must be found.


Each block of data in the blockchain is called a transaction.
And it contains the following information:
- The previous hash of the block
- The data: ranging from anything like a transaction, to a block of data
- Hash Value: The hash of the block which is basically it's id
- Timestamo: The time the block was created
- Nonce(Proof-of-work): The number of times the block has been mined

## What is a blockchain?
A blockchain is a collection of blocks. It is a chain of blocks that are linked together.
